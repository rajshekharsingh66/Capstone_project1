# **Problem Statement**
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland. Explore and analyze the data to discover key findings pertaining to terrorist activities.

Main Libraries to be used:

* Pandas for data manipulation, aggregation
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualisation and behaviour with respect to the target variable. Use at least 5 different visualisations.
* NumPy for computationally efficient operations
     
# **Project Summary -**     
Our project delves into the intricate realm of global terrorism, aiming to extract meaningful insights from a comprehensive dataset. This dataset serves as a crucial repository of information, shedding light on the multifaceted nature of terrorist activities worldwide. To embark on this analytical journey, we first navigate through the basics: understanding what this dataset encapsulates and the tools required for our analysis.

1. What this dataset is all about?
The dataset encompasses a wide array of information, detailing terrorist incidents globally. It spans several years and provides data on the motives, methods, and impact of these activities, offering a nuanced understanding of the global terrorism landscape.

2. Installation of Libraries and Dataset
Our analysis hinges on the power of Python's data analysis stack, employing libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations. Additionally, we utilize the 'os' library for efficient file handling. Importantly, we load and preprocess the dataset to make it amenable to our analytical techniques.

3. Basic Analysis
We kick off our exploration with basic statistical analyses, gaining insights into the dataset's structure and dimensions. Descriptive statistics provide an initial understanding of the data's central tendencies and variations.

4. Motive Behind Activities Related to Terrorism
One of the pivotal questions we tackle involves understanding the motives driving terrorist activities. By employing sophisticated analytical methods, we unravel patterns and discern underlying motives, bringing context to seemingly disparate incidents.

5. Number of Terrorist Activities Occurred in Region with Respect to Year
A temporal analysis helps us dissect the dataset across years and regions, discerning trends and fluctuations. This analysis provides a nuanced perspective on the evolving nature of terrorism worldwide.

6. Number of Terrorist Activities vs Year
Visual representations, crafted using Matplotlib and Seaborn, elucidate the relationship between the number of terrorist activities and the passage of time. These visualizations offer compelling insights into the dataset's temporal patterns.

7. Who Are the Main Targets?
By dissecting the data, we identify primary targets of terrorist activities. This information is vital for understanding the societal, political, and economic impacts of such incidents.

8. Hot Zones of Terrorism by Country and City
Geospatial analyses pinpoint terrorism hotspots, unveiling regions and cities most affected by these activities. Visual representations overlaying maps provide a striking portrayal of these hot zones.

9. What Are the Attacking Methods Used?
Our exploration extends to the methods employed in these attacks. By categorizing and visualizing these methods, we discern patterns that offer insights into the strategies of different terrorist groups.

10. Attacks vs Killed
A critical analysis revolves around understanding the correlation between the number of attacks and the fatalities they cause. This analysis underscores the devastating impact of terrorism on human lives.

11. Most Notorious Groups
Delving deep into the dataset, we identify and analyze the most notorious terrorist groups. Understanding these groups is pivotal for global security efforts.

# **Conclusion**
In summary, we've explored different forms of analysis and engaged in question-and-answer sessions with a dataset that piqued my interest. I'd like to highlight something valuable I've discovered. When we merely glance at a dataset, all we can discern is the column information and its contents. Therefore, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) proves to be an incredibly effective method to simplify our tasks. Thanks to Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly, we're equipped to draw conclusions, perform calculations, and create visualizations, greatly enhancing our analytical capabilities.


Based on the preceding analysis, we can draw the following conclusions:
* Iraq ranks highest in the number of attacks.
* The Middle and East Africa region experiences the highest number of attacks.
* The predominant weapon employed by terrorists is explosives.
* Within the analysis, it is evident that in 2014, Iraq witnessed the highest level of terrorist activities.
* Private citizens and property emerge as the primary targets of terrorist activities.
* The most prevalent methods in terrorism activities involve bombing and explosions.
* The Taliban stands out as the most notorious group, having been involved in the highest number of terrorist activities.
